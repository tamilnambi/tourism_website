        Tamil Nadu has 4 international airports and 3 domestic airports. Chennai
        International Airport is a major international airport that is connected
        with 19 countries with more than 169 direct flights every week. This is
        the third largest airport in India. Other international airports present
        in the state are Coimbatore International Airport, Madurai International
        Airport and Tiruchirappalli International Airport. Salem and Tuticorin
        Airports are domestic airports with convenient connections to the rest
        of the state and the country.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="first">B</span>y train</h2>
      <p>
        Tamil Nadu is served by Southern Railway and there are many trains from
        Chennai to almost every major city in India. Chennai serves as a gateway
        city for connections from other parts of Tamil Nadu.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="first">B</span>y bus</h2>
      <p>
        Everybody can get easy around the state between the cities using swift
        transportation available locally. However, it is advised that cabs
        should be pre-booked to avoid any kind of inconvenience. Chennai is one
        point on the Golden Quadrilateral, the construction of limited access
        divided highways that link circumnavigate the heart of India. Chennai
        has one of Asia's largest bus stations, CMBT. There are hourly buses for
        places like Tirupati, Pondicherry, Coimbatore. You will get the option
        of A/C or Non-A/C coaches for cities like Bangalore, Trivandrum,
        Hyderabad. During the weekends most buses are fully occupied and it's
        better to reserve a ticket in advance. All buses terminate near
        Koyambedu, but there are different stands for state owned(CMBT) and
        private buses (Omni bus terminus). Both these terminuses are near each
        other, and it is better to tell your exact destination to the driver.
        Buses usually drop passengers at various points in the city before
        reaching the terminus.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="first">B</span>est period to travel</h2>
      <p>
        The winters are very mild, the summers are hot and the rest of the year
        is warm. The ideal time to travel is from
        <strong>December to March</strong>, when the weather is mild. Summer
        season starts in April and lasts till June. Temperatures peak is in May
        and lessens from July till the rains start. It is important to remember
        that the monsoon in Tamil Nadu starts in mid-October and lasts till
        early December unlike the rest of India. This is because the State lies
        in the rain shadow region and the monsoon winds bypass the State (though
        southern parts of the State gets some rains in June/July).
